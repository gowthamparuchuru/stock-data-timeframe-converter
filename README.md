# stock-data-timeframe-converter
This is a python code to convert the time frame of stocks data from ticks to any higher time frame like 5min,15min,30min,1hr etc.,

Note: If the input data is given in CSV format then this code works very fast, but if given as some txt file with space as delimiter ( as used in this code ), then this program takes a lot of time to run.
It almost took 2 hrs for me to process 2.5 years of 1min data into 15mins.
